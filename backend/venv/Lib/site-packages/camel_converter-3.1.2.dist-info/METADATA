In JSON keys are frequently in camelCase format, while variable names in Python are typically
snake_case. The purpose of this pacakgae is to help convert between the two formats.

## Usage

- To convert from camel case to snake case:

  ```py
  from camel_converter import to_snake

  snake = to_snake("myString")
  ```

  This will convert `myString` into `my_string`

- To convert a dictonary's keys from camel case to snake case:

  ```py
  from camel_converter import dict_to_snake

  snake = dict_to_snake({"myString": "val 1"})
  ```

  This will convert `{"myString": "val 1"}` into `{"my_string": "val 1"}`. Non-string keys will be
  left unchanged.

  This is also available as a decorator for functions that return a dictionary.

  ```py
  from camel_converter.decorators import dict_to_snake

  @dict_to_snake
  def my_func() -> dict[str, str]:
      return {"myString": "val 1"}

  snake = my_func()
  ```

  `my_func` will return `{"my_string": "val 1"}`. Non-string keys will be
  left unchanged.

- To convert from snake case to camel case:

  ```py
  from camel_converter import to_camel

  camel = to_camel("my_string")
  ```

  This will convert `my_string` into `myString`

- To convert from a dictionary's keys from snake case to camel case:

  ```py
  from camel_converter import dict_to_camel

  camel = to_camel({"my_string": "val 1"})
  ```

  This will convert `{"my_string": "val 1"}` into `{"myString": "val 1"}` Non-string keys will be
  left unchanged.

  This is also available as a decorator for functions that return a dictionary.

  ```py
  from camel_converter.decorators import dict_to_camel

  @dict_to_camel
  def my_func() -> dict[str, str]:
      return {"my_string": "val 1"}

  camel = my_func()
  ```

  `my_func` will return `{"myString": "val 1"}`. Non-string keys will be
  left unchanged.

- To convert from snake to pascal case:

  ```py
  from camel_converter import to_pascal

  pascal = to_pascal("my_string")
  ```

  This will convert `my_string` into `MyString`

- To convert from a dictionary's keys from snake case to pascal case:

  ```py
  from camel_converter import dict_to_pascal

  pascal = to_pascal({"my_string": "val 1"})
  ```

  This will convert `{"my_string": "val 1"}` into `{"MyString": "val 1"}` Non-string keys will be
  left unchanged.

  This is also available as a decorator for functions that return a dictionary.

  ```py
  from camel_converter.decorators import dict_to_pascal

  @dict_to_pascal
  def my_func() -> dict[str, str]:
      return {"my_string": "val 1"}

  pascal = my_func()
  ```

  `my_func` will return `{"MyString": "val 1"}`. Non-string keys will be
  left unchanged.

### Optional Extras

An optional extra is provided for [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) that provides a
base class to automatically convert between snake case and camel case. To use this Pydantic class
install camel converter with:

```sh
pip install camel-converter[pydantic]
```

Then your Pydantic classes can inherit from CamelBase.

```py
from camel_converter.pydantic_base import CamelBase


class MyModel(CamelBase):
    test_field: str


my_data = MyModel(**{"testField": "my value"})
print(my_data.test_field)
```

will result in `my value` being printed.

With setting up your model in this way `myField` from the source, i.e. JSON data, will map to `my_field` in your model.
