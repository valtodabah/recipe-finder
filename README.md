This project is a recipe finder, a web application that helps users search and discover recipes. To provide a fast search experience, I integrated Meilisearch into the application.
The search is quick and user-friendly, handling typos.
Technologies used:
  Backend: Python and Flask
  Search Engine: Meilisearch
  Frontend: React.js
