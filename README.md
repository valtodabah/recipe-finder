This project is a recipe finder, a web application that helps users search and discover recipes. To provide a fast search experience, I integrated Meilisearch into the application.
The search is quick and user-friendly, handling typos and accepting cooking time as a filter.

Technologies used:
  Backend: Python and Flask
  Search Engine: Meilisearch
  Frontend: React.js

Vercel link (the first search may take a minute due to free-tier backend hosting): https://recipe-finder-lac-six.vercel.app/
